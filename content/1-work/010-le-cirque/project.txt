Text: Le Cirque was an on-going, themed event produced and hosted by The Brookyln Circus.

High-class elegance with the vintage-inspired “BKc” touch dominated the aesthetic for Le Cirque events. I worked to capture that spirit in a visual identity they could use for advertising and other promotional materials.
