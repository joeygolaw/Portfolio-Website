Text: The Brooklyn Circus is a boutique men's clothing brand with locations in San Francisco and Brooklyn. They're dedicated to preserving and building upon iconic American style.

I worked with them to update the design and content of the Brooklyn Good Times to better align with their creative direction and vision.
