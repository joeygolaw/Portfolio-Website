Text: Water Planet Engineering is a water technology solutions provider based out of Los Angeles, CA. They focus on developing technologies for desalination and water reuse.

I worked with them to explore a complete redesign of their visual identity focused on communicating their company's noble vision of water solutions that preserve our planet's most precious resource.
