Text: Chroma Chroma was the inaugural art party for Room and Makers, an artist collective and co-working space in San Francisco, CA. It featured new work by L.A. photographers Lauren Randolph and Jimmy Marble.

I designed the campaign to promote the event, led the design and development of the event's animated webpage, and helped curate and install the show.
