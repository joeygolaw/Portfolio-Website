Text: *A warm cup of chai is an important ritual, a delicious break from the day. With Chime you can brew authentic chai, effortlessly.*

Chime is the first connected device for chai. I worked with them on refining their brand identity, art direction, and on the creation of their network of digital productsâ€”including a marketing website and the interface on the machine itself.
