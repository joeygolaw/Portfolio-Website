Text: A trip to Uruguay inspired Christina DesVaux to start Textura, an apparel company based in Brooklyn, New York. Her brand specializes in hand-knit wool garments, products, and textiles.

I worked with her to develop a visual identity for Textura that brought together her taste for modern fashion and genuine nostalgia. We developed a script logo that hints at a needle and thread—one that seems familiar—but with a modern edge. Additonal service included an e-commerce website.
