Text: Water Planet Engineering is a water technology solutions provider based out of Los Angeles, CA. They focus on developing technologies for desalination and water reuse.

I worked with them to create a holiday e-card that was whimsical, yet professional. The final design playfully spoke to the work they do to protect one of our planet's most precious resources.
