Text: Bayroot Productions is a collective of musicians who've been creating soundtracks for recording artists, films, documentaries, and video games for over 15 years.

I created the artwork for their most recent compilation, *The Junk Boat*, which included a promotional map featuring hand-lettered titles of their four full-length releases, as well as album artwork that felt as though it washed up on the shore along with the always-foreign sound that their music embodies.
