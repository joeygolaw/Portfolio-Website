Text: Drew and Christa Kachurak are good friends of mine so I didn't hesitate when they asked me to help create their wedding inviations.

When it came time for the actual ceremony, their minister—a man who has seen Drew and Christa grow separately, and together—based his short matrimonial sermon on the concept I executed on their invitation, the idea of two individuals planting the seed for a life of growth, love, and eventual wisdom. Amen.
