Text: Cafe Finder is a coneptual app I worked on with WeGeeks, an engineering firm located in San Francisco, CA.

The app aimed to assist users in finding the exact coffee shop theyâ€™re looking for based on their personal trends and preferences, giving fellow coffee-drinkers the information they need to navigate uncharted territory in search of caffeine and a wifi connection.
