Text: You Are Hear is a New York label imprint focused on the electronic music landscapeâ€”everything from disco to deep house and techno.

I worked with them to create a visual identity inspired by the iconic New York Subway system, as well as their first official website showcasing their artists, catalog, and upcoming events.
