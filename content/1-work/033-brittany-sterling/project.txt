Text: Brittany Sterling is a freelance artist and arts community advocate. Her work is focused on portrait painting, photo storytelling, and art workshops and events.

I worked with her to create a portfolio website that showcased her strong ability to tell engaging visual narratives. The final website showcases her photography and artwork, and includes an online shop.
