Text: The Rights Workshop is a music supervision, licensing, and creative clearance company with locations in San Francisco and Los Angeles, CA. 

I worked with them to redesign their marketing website, focusing on clearly conveying their licensing services, resources, and experience. The final website is responsive, and features subtle scrolling effects.
