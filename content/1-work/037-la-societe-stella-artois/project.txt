Text: Stella Artois was a client of SIGN, a platform for displaying interactive content on touchscreen devices in retail stores.

They ran three campaigns using SIGN: La Societé Stella Artois, 1-800-Chalice, and The Ritual, all which featured different content and communications.

I worked with them to help produce the interface and content for each campaign. Services included animation, product design, and supporting campaign communications.
