Text: My mother's baked goods were especially good, and something she took pride in. She always talked about selling them, a point me and my siblings would joke with her about. Now, we can't teaseher anymore; sheâ€™s finally done it!

She asked me, her designer-son, to her help brand her baked goods. The visual identity includes a modern script logotype, a warm and vibrant color palette, and adornment graphics.
