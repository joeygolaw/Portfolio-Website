Text: Room and Makers was a collaborative workspace in SoMa, San Francisco. It has since transformed into a collective of artists and creatives.

I co-founded the original co-working space with Brittany Sterling, and together we manage and promote the collective through art shows and events.

I created the visual identity for Room and Makers, led the design for each art show, and developed engaging webpages to promote and support major events.
