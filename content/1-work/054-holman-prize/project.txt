Text: *Lighthouse for the Blind is a non-profit promoting equality and the self-reliance of people who are blind or visually impaired, through rehabilitation training and employment placement, among other relevant services.*

Every year, the Holman Prize funds the projects of three ambitious blind people from around the world. I worked with Lighthouse for the Blind to develop an identity for the annual prize, and to implement that for the Holman Prize website.
