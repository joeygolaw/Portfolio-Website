Text: Brothers of the Beard was a promotional campaign created to help advertise Movember, the annual event involving the growing of moustaches during the month of November to raise awareness of men's health issues.

I worked with them to create a visual identity and responsive website advertising the campaign. This included a myriad of “bearded” avatars that visitors could download and use as their own on social networks.
