Text: A tiny little imprint run by (link: http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-red-balloon/id327257120 text: Richie Panelli) and Pharoah Davis, Dorm Room Muzik got it's start in their college dorm room. Despite both of them graduating on to stable careers (practicing audiologists and fire fighter, respectively) they continue to make music.

I worked with them to help put a face to their passion for music. We ended up with a visual identity that felt right, embodying both old and new influences.
