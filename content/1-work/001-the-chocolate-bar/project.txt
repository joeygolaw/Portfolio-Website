Text: The Chocolate Bar is a restaurant and lounge with three locations in the Reno/Lake Tahoe area.

I worked with them to expand their brand and communications to include a mix of vibrant simplicity and metropolitan appeal. Services included everything from advertising and menu design to in-house signage and music mixes.
