Text: The Brooklyn Circus is a boutique men's clothing brand with locations in San Francisco and Brooklyn. They're dedicated to preserving and building upon iconic American style.

I worked with them on a wide-range of communications focused on expanding the visual identity through promotional materials, in-store signage, and creating in-house brands.
