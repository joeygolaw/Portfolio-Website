Text: Camper Goods is a multi-phased business concept designed to bring fresh, healthy, and organic food and product choices to communities that donâ€™t have as diverse of a selection of natural options.

I worked with them to create a visual identity that focused on and integrated the concepts of sustainability, nature, and the modern life.
