Text: Lindsay Louise is a jewelry company located in San Francisco, CA. They create unique, handmade products for everyday wear that are pleasantly simple.

I worked with Lindsay Hobbs—half of the company's namesake—to create a visual identity that accentuated the geometric style of her products and directly appealed to the demographic that would find her one-of-a-kind pieces appealing.
